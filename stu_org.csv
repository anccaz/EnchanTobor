"Bujo Buddies UTD","Social, Recreation, Art and Music","Description: Bujo Buddies UTD is an organization centered around the hobby of bullet journaling, which is a beloved organizational tool and creative outlet that allows people to express their artistic talents through drawing, scrapbooking, doodling, and the use of fun stationery such as washi tape and stickers, while also being a resource to plan out important tasks in a given month, week, and year overall. Bullet journaling encourages the idea of ""spreads"", which is a creative layout of everything planned for a certain time period. For example, creating a monthly spread would be decorating a cover page dedicated to the month's themes, and then creating a calendar and filling in important dates and deadlines within it. A weekly spread would be taking one week from the monthly calendar and focusing on it more to highlight details on what is important for that given week. Bullet journaling appeals to those who are artistic and want to express themselves through beautiful calligraphy and stationery like stickers, cutouts, washi tape, colored pens, and more, but it also appeals to those who want a more organizational and functional form of planning. Outside of bullet journaling, our organization will also plan activities related to bullet journaling in some form such as calligraphy workshops, pen palling events, stationery swaps, and more. Most importantly, Bujo Buddies UTD emphasizes inclusion and friendship. We want everyone in our organization to feel comfortable and included as our members, and we want everyone to have their voices heard in terms of what type of events they would like to see. Whether one has been bullet journaling for years or is interested in getting started, Bujo Buddies UTD will strive to bring everyone together and bullet journal in order to encourage accountability and productivity in a cute and artistic manner.

Mission: The mission of Bujo Buddies UTD is to create a positive, friendly space for those interested in bullet journaling to come together and share ideas for bullet journaling spreads and explore the art of aesthetics, productivity, and organization in a medium that promotes creativity, design, and self-care. 

Purpose: Our purpose is to allow students to view bullet journaling as a stress-reliving organizational tool that only requires a space to express themselves, such as a digital or traditional journal, and their own brilliant ideas. We seek to unite students in the making planning their busy college lives more fun through friendships and bujo!

"MBAs for Christ","Religious","Statement of Purpose: MBAs for Christ exists to glorify God by encouraging graduate JSOM students in their devotion and submission to Jesus Christ. This organization is “religious,” as defined by the SOC.

We affirm the following core values:
1.Our Identity is in Christ“...for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 3:23-24)Despite the pressures of the professional world, we deny that our identity, purpose, or personal worth is found in our professional success, productivity, or performance. Rather, we affirm that our lives are in Jesus Christ, the One who has justified and redeemed us through His broken body and spilt blood.

2.Our Purpose is to Pursue Christ“ See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority.” (Colossians2:8-10)Even as we learn important business lessons as graduatestudents at UTD, we affirm our reliance on and submission to Jesus Christ. We commit to pursuing Christ in all things, trusting in His sufficiency, authority, and wisdom.We choose to exalt Jesus, His perspective, and His wisdom above all else.3.Our Work is our Worship“Whatever you do, work heartily,as for the Lord and not for men,knowing that from the Lordyou will receive the inheritance as your reward.You are serving the Lord Christ.” (Colossians

3:23-24)As working professionalsand students, we believe our careers are an offering unto Jesus Christ. As such, we seek to integrate our faith and workunder the leadership of the Holy Spirit and unto the glory of our Father in Heaven.

4.Our Unity is in our Devotion to Christ and our Love for One Another“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.” (John 15:12)

In accordance with the historic creeds of the church (that is, the Nicene Creed and the Apostle’s Creed, see Appendix A), we affirm that our love for Jesus Christ compels us to love one another as He first loved us. In all things, we seek to show Christ-like love in wordand deed to our fellow JSOMstudents, ourco-workers, and our communities","Carolyn Duke","cxd220011@utdallas.edu","/sites/StudentOrganizationCenterSP/Shared%20Documents/Apps/Microsoft%20Forms/Organization%20Registration%20Form/Cover%20Image/MBAs%20for%20Christ%20Fall%2022_Carolyn%20Duke.png"

"Student Tutors Reviving Identity through Volunteerism and Education","[""Academic Interests"",""Educational/Departmental"",""Services""]","STRIVE was founded in 2019 to help underprivileged students in the DFW metroplex have the chance to live up to their true potential. Our initiative first started as a means for Refugee and ESL students to work with select mentors. Our work focused on helping the students overcome language barriers, learn that diversity is indeed accepted, and to think beyond primary education. This initiative was a success as we had a lot of students interested in higher education after various discussions.

Unfortunately, many of them struggled to gain acceptance due to the compounding effects of the language barrier. Without a solid grasp of English, performance in various other subjects takes a significant hit. Based on this dilemma, we decided that it was essential to develop a tutoring program for these students to connect them with tutor-mentors from similar backgrounds who would guide the students and allow them to overcome this barrier.

We see a bright future for these students, and we want to tap into their potential by providing them with one-on-one subject strategy training and educational advice. Our motto is that every student should have the right to succeed regardless of their background. Language should not be an obstacle to success. We currently work with Lake Highlands High School in the Richardson Independent School District (RISD).  Currently looking to expand, we look forward to continuing our mission to eliminate educational disparities.","Zaid Memon","Zaid.Memon@UTDallas.edu","/sites/StudentOrganizationCenterSP/Lists/Student%20Organization%20Directory/Attachments/1030/252fStudent2blist252f5742bLogo2b2022_Khadija%252bShariff.png"
