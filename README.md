EnchanTobor

## Inspiration
As current freshman who went through the on-boarding process, we felt as though the number of school organizations on campus were overwhelming and it difficult to narrow down what clubs or organizations fit our interests. 

## What it does
We created a website for freshman engineering students to be introduced to the over 300 student clubs and organizations on campus, find a space to explore their interests, and ultimately be better connected to their classmates.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, R, PHP, and JavaScript to build our web application.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into issues with our parallax scrolling feature and survey database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of our welcome page that features the parallax images and detailed survey!

## What we learned
We learned how to use R to create a survey and implement a parallax feature into a web application.

## What's next for EnchanTobor
We're excited to send our incoming engineering freshman friends this website as a resource for their upcoming educational endeavors at UT Dallas.
